# Big-Data-Management-and-Analysis-1
This repository includes the first exercises I've done with my Big Data class.
The get_bus_info.py takes the mta_key from the mta bus api, a bus line number and an output csv file and returns the most recent latitude, longtitude, stopname, stopstatus of the bus line.
The show_bus_locations.py takes the mta_key and bus line number and prints the latitude and longitude of all the buses on the bus line.


sample output file is included as well as sets of vehicle data.
